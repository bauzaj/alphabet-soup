## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/bauzaj/alphabet-soup.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn keras

## Data Preprocessing
The data used for training the model should be preprocessed before training. Use the preprocess_data.ipynb notebook or any other suitable method to preprocess the data.

## Model Training
Open the aplhabet_soup.ipynb notebook.

Set the necessary configurations for the neural network model, such as the number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, etc.

Run the notebook to train the model on the preprocessed data.

## Model Evaluation
After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the evaluate_model.ipynb notebook. This notebook will provide various metrics and visualizations to assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance measures.

## Exporting the Model
To export the trained model for future use, you can use the save() method provided by Keras. This will save the entire model, including the architecture and learned weights, to an HDF5 file.
